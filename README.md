# AL-Admission-checker
## About
I guess because of the COVID Government gave chance to get our admission form from online..
Since they don't have any verification methods.
you can just download anyone's admission submitting their index no..<br>
   https://admission.doenets.lk

<br>
Since the Index numbers are not issued in a order... This will check theck the numbers one by one and give the issued index number list.

- If you want to check the admission form of a particular index no, <br>
  Go to https://admission.doenets.lk/api/admission/{refference} <br>
  <samp>replace {refference} with the refference number</samp>
